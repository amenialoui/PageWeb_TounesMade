    <h2 id="Sustainibility">In a circular fashion</h2>
    <p>The clothing production cycle is a linear process of making, wearing, and throwing away.

        We need to work together to buy less and buy better when shopping. Everyone knows the thrill of wearing something for the first time, however each purchase supports the harmful production cycle of water pollution, labor abuse, and textile waste that the fashion industry is known for. By the time a product reaches a customer, most of the damage is already done.</p>
    <h3>We're here to change that. </h3>
